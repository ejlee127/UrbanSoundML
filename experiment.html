            The experiment, of course, is to find the best model
            for the machine to classify the Urban sound by traing
            the machine with the sample data. The term 'best'
            is determined by the 'accuracy'. Our goal was to achieve
            the accuracy of 
            <a href="http://www.justinsalamon.com/uploads/4/3/9/4/4394963/salamon_urbansound_acmmm14.pdf" target="_blank">
              the original work </a> 
            as much as possible. In the process, there were two important
            considerations:
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5> Cross validation</h5>
            <p>
              When learning machine learning algorithms, we were taught using
              train_test_split() method in sklearn.model_selection, which
              splits samples into random train and test subsets.
              If we apply this method to our samples, which were constructed
              from all folders(fold1~fold10) in the dataset, the rows of the sample are
              shuffled in random selections. The authors mentioned 'do not shuffle' because
              <p class="p-cite">
                "If you reshuffle the data 
                (e.g. combine the data from all folds and 
                generate a random train/test split) 
                you will be incorrectly placing related samples 
                in both the train and test sets, 
                leading to inflated scores that don't represent 
                your model's performance on unseen data. 
                Put simply, your results will be wrong.""
              </p>
            </p>
            <h5> Overfitting </h5>
            <p> The early stage of experiments shows the following training history with neuron=128,             showing overfitting. We took care of this with drop-out and regularization:

              Experiment 1, 2 and 3 take Sample 1, 2 and 3 respectively.
              For training, we used Sequential model. To find best parameters for
              each experiment, we run the training process for all combinations
              of the following parameters.
              <ul>
                <li>number of neurons = [64, 128, 256, 512]</li>
                <li>dropouts = [0.3, 0.4, 0.5]</li>
                <li>epochs = [30, 40, 50]</li>
                <li>batch sizes = [16, 32]</li>
              </ul>
              For the cross validation, we chose four subsets as
              <table border="0" class="dataframe table table-responsive table-striped">
                <thead>
                  <tr style="text-align: center;">      
                    <th>Folders for test</th>      
                    <th>Folders for validation</th>      
                    <th>Folders for train</th> 
                  </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                  <tr>
                    <td> fold 1, 2</td>
                    <td> fold 3 </td>
                    <td> fold 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 </td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td> fold 4, 5</td>
                    <td> fold 6 </td>
                    <td> fold 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3 </td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td> fold 7, 8</td>
                    <td> fold 9 </td>
                    <td> fold 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 </td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td> fold 10, 1</td>
                    <td> fold 2 </td>
                    <td> fold 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 </td>
                  </tr>
                </tbody>
              </table>
              which produce four traing results. We take average of four
              accuracy values, representing the result <a href="result.html#sequentialresult">here</a>.
            </div>
            <h5 class="card-title"> Experiment 4</h5>
            <div class="card-text">
              The best accuracy in the
              <a href="" >article</a> was obtained from SVM-rbf model. We also
              used this model in the experiment 4. The paraemter for SVM-rbf is set as default
              of sklearn.svm.SVC(kernel='rbf'). The input for this experiment is Sample 3, which
              is of n_mfcc=30 with the six statistical values of the MFCC vectors. Standardization of
              the samples is common requirement, to make sure this 'common sense', we
              performed training model for both non-scaled and scaled samples.
              For the cross validation, we take each folder as test input and other nine folders as train input,
              resulting ten accuracy values. We take average of them, representing the result <a href="result.html#svmresult">here</a>.
